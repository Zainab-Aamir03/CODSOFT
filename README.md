**Task 1:** To make a To Do List App using python <br />
**Task 2:** Calculator <br />
**Task 3:** Password Generator <br />
**Task 4:** Contact Book <br />
# To Do List App:
A To-Do List is a list that helps individuals organize, prioritize, and manage their tasks or activities that you need to carry out.
It is an effective way of to keep tracks of the things that need to be doe in time or under some deadlines.
The main purpose of To Do List is time management. While creating a To Do List you must keep the following steps in mind. <br />
• **Tasks <br />
•	Prriorities of Tasks<br />
•	Deadline of Tasks <br />
•	Checkboxes** <br />
In this task I have created a simple ToDo List that runs on the VS terminal. The basic functions are discussed below.<br />
• **Adding Task:** This function add new tasks to the list. <br />
•	**Removing Task:** This function removes the tasks from the list after completion.<br />
•	**Displaying Tasks:** This function shows the task that are added to the list. <br />
•	**Exiting the app:**  This function closes the app after on user input. <br />
See the [ToDo List](https://github.com/Zainab-Aamir03/CODSOFT/blob/main/To_do_list.py) code here. <br />

# Calculator:
In this task I have created a simple operation that performs 4 basic operations of a calculator i-e 
 <br />
• **Addition <br />
•	Subtraction<br />
•	Multiplication<br />
•	Division** <br />
On running the file it ask the users the operation that they want to perform on numbers by giving the user choices. After that it prompt the user about the total numbers that he want to perform operations at and then the take number input form the users and calculates the results and print it. The code can also handle the error if the user input is not correct and also an arithmetic error if the user tries to divide by Zero. <br />
See the [Caclulator Code here](https://github.com/Zainab-Aamir03/CODSOFT/blob/main/Calculator.py). And [Output of the code](https://github.com/Zainab-Aamir03/CODSOFT/blob/main/calculator%20output.PNG) at VS terminal can be seen here.
